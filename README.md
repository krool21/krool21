# About me...


Hello, Iâ€™m Carol Toledo, and Iâ€™m currently a junior pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering at UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico). Growing up in Monterrey, Nuevo LeÃ³n, Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by the mechanics behind everyday objects. From a young age, I loved taking apart old electronics and figuring out how they worked, which sparked my passion for engineering.

During high school, my interest in engineering deepened through various science fairs and technology competitions. One of my most memorable projects was designing a small-scale wind turbine, which not only won first place in a national science competition but also solidified my decision to follow a career in mechanical engineering.

At UNAM, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in both my studies and extracurricular activities. Iâ€™m actively involved in the Robotics Club, where Iâ€™ve worked on several projects, including designing and building robots for national contests. Leading our team in a recent competition was a rewarding challenge and allowed me to apply my theoretical knowledge to practical problems.

Academically, Iâ€™m committed to excellence and have consistently been on the Deanâ€™s List. Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to intern with a leading engineering firm, where I assisted in the development of mechanical systems and gained hands-on experience with CAD software and thermal analysis. These experiences have been invaluable in bridging the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, Iâ€™m passionate about giving back to the community. I volunteer with organizations that promote STEM education among young students, conducting workshops and mentoring them. Itâ€™s incredibly fulfilling to inspire others and share my enthusiasm for engineering.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited about specializing in robotics and automation. I believe these fields have the potential to revolutionize industries and improve the quality of life, and Iâ€™m eager to contribute to these advancements.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, experimenting with recipes in the kitchen, and hiking in the beautiful landscapes around Monterrey. These activities help me stay balanced and energized.

Iâ€™m grateful for the experiences Iâ€™ve had at UNAM and am looking forward to continuing my journey in mechanical engineering. Iâ€™m excited about the opportunities ahead and eager to make a meaningful impact in my field.
